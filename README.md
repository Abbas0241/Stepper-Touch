Stepper Touch for Android based on a Material Up showcase designed by [Oleg Frolov](https://material.uplabs.com/posts/stepper-touch-interface)

In the latest version of the support library (25.3.0) a new class SpringAnimation was made available. I wanted to test this out not long after that I found this Stepper Touch on Material Up. I decided to create this for Android and play with SpringAnimations.

#### TODO
- Demo coming soon, in the meantime you can clone the project to check it out yourself.
- I will also make it available through maven.
